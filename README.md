Repository for scripts and code for the formosa project.

## Data Processing Scripts
In `data-processing` there are the following files:
	- `processMultiBoardBinary_v9.py`: converts .dat files into root files
	- `utilsMultipeak_v9.py` and `utils_v9.py` are auxiliary files for `processMultiBoardBinary_v9.py`
	- `double_gaussian_fit.py`: takes in root files, creates a hisogram with fitting gaussian distributions
